# Study Material Repository

### General Information

This repository contains all materials, data and data analysis files associated with the online-study documented in the research paper "Tracking stress via
the computer mouse? Promise and challenges of a potential behavioral stress marker" by Freihaut, Rockstroh, Blum & Göritz.

### Repository Structure

The repository contains 4 main elements:

1. The folder Experimental_App contains the original React.js web application (in German), which was used in the study.
2. The folder Datasets contains the raw data file that includes all data from the experiment as well as all data files
that were created from the raw data file and used for specific data analysis purpose
3. The folder Data_Preparation_Code contains all code files that were used to process the data (e.g. to calculate and save
the mouse usage features from the raw mouse data)
4. The folder Data_Analysis_Code contains alls code files that were used to analyze the data

All data files should be able to be excecutable to reproduce all data preprocessing and data analysis as reported in the paper.
We tried to comment the code as much as possible to help navigating through it.
